* Army composition

Rincewind:
* Worker/city ratio
* Free unit timing (ballista, etc.)

Siontific
* Actual time played of matches: https://github.com/becked/prospector/blob/main/docs/plans/youtube-playtime-tracking-implementation-plan.md 
* Average science/turn, military score/turn, legitimacy/turn, orders/turn across all games in graph

Alcaras
* Law and tech turn side-by-side (we have a similar viz, law/tech tempo, so this should be next to this on page and use the same underlying data probably)
* City founding timeline, perhaps in a new maps tab with other map related viz?

Other
* Generative AI summary is terrible. Need to certainly do a better job in stage one, to filter to important events, as well as stage two with a prompt that makes it more concise so as to have less of its shitty filler words.
* Matches -> Player Statistics -> Yields Comparison probably shouldn't look at science and orders in this chart, also validate the calculation.
