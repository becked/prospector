## 2025-10-25: Initial Archive Organization

**Context**: Organized docs/ to help new developers distinguish active from completed documentation.

**Approach**: Hybrid (Option C) - Archive completed plans and reports while keeping active docs current.

**Changes**:

### Created Archive Structure
- `archive/plans/` - Completed implementation plans
- `archive/reports/` - Historical analysis reports
- `archive/issues/` - Resolved issues
- `archive/code-reviews/` - Point-in-time reviews
- `archive/deployment/` - Old deployment docs

### Archived Files

**Plans** (29 files):
- LogData/MemoryData ingestion plans
- Turn-by-turn history implementation plans
- Visualization implementation plans
- Participant tracking plans
- Google Drive integration plans
- Pick order tracking plans
- Override system plans
- Deployment plans
- Ruler tracking plan
- Narrative generation plan

**Reports** (5 files):

### Active Documentation Retained

- `developer-guide.md` - Architecture and workflows
- `deployment-guide.md` - Deployment procedures
- `migrations/*.md` - All 6 migration docs (historical record)
- `reference/save-file-format.md` - Save file specification
- `README.md` - Navigation guide (NEW)

### Guidelines Added
