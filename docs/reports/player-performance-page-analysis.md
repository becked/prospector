## Executive Summary

The Player Performance page serves as a comprehensive analytics dashboard for tournament player statistics. It provides four distinct analytical perspectives through a tabbed interface: Player Rankings, Civilization Analysis, Head-to-Head comparisons, and Performance Trends. The page successfully balances high-level summaries, comparative visualizations, detailed data tables, and advanced analytics to serve different analytical needs.

---

## Primary Goals

The Player Performance page has four main objectives:

1. **Player Evaluation** - Identify top performers based on win rates and activity levels
2. **Civilization Meta-Analysis** - Understand which civilizations are strongest and most popular
3. **Competitive Balance** - Compare players head-to-head to understand rivalries and matchups
4. **Trend Analysis** - Track player performance evolution over time and identify civilization preferences

---

## Page Structure

### Filters Section

Three interactive filters that apply across all tabs:

- **Date Range**: Filter matches by time period (currently "All time")
- **Civilizations**: Multi-select dropdown to filter by specific civilizations
- **Minimum Matches Slider**: Filter out players with fewer than N matches (1-20 range) to focus on statistically significant data

The filtering logic cascades from these top-level controls to all visualizations, ensuring consistency across the page.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Queries

The page uses several database query methods from `tournament_visualizer.data.queries`:

- `get_player_performance()`: Main player stats aggregation
  - Returns: player_name, total_matches, wins, win_rate, civilization, avg_score, favorite_civilization

- `get_civilization_performance()`: Civilization-level statistics
  - Returns: civilization, total_matches, wins, win_rate, avg_score, unique_players

- `get_head_to_head_stats(player1, player2)`: Direct matchup data
  - Returns: total_matches, player1_wins, player2_wins, avg_match_length

- Direct SQL for timeline chart (lines 1061-1072):
  - Joins matches and players tables
  - Filters for completed matches with dates
  - Returns temporal data for cumulative calculations

### Filtering Logic

- Filters cascade from top-level controls to all visualizations
- Minimum matches filter ensures statistical relevance
- Civilization filter affects both player and civilization tabs
- Date range filter applies to all temporal queries

### Reactive Callbacks

All visualizations use Dash callbacks that respond to:
- `players-date-dropdown` changes
- `players-civilizations-dropdown` changes
- `min-matches-slider` changes
- `refresh-interval` n_intervals (for auto-refresh)

### Error Handling

The page implements comprehensive error handling:
- Try-except blocks around all callback functions
- Empty state messages for no data scenarios
- Placeholder charts with explanatory messages
- User-friendly error messages in UI

## Data Quality Observations

### Current Gaps

1. **Avg Score** shows 0.0 for all entries
   - Scoring system not yet implemented OR
   - Score data not being captured from save files OR
   - Query not aggregating score correctly

2. **Favorite Civ** column empty
   - Aggregation logic needs implementation
   - Requires mode/most-frequent calculation per player
   - Could be added to `get_player_performance()` query

3. **Limited Sample Size Effects**
   - Many players at 100% or 0% win rates (1-2 matches only)
   - Win rate rankings will stabilize with more tournament data
   - Statistical significance improves with minimum matches filter

### Data Integrity

- Player ID mapping correctly implemented (XML 0-based → Database 1-based)
- Win/loss tracking appears accurate
- Civilization assignments properly captured
- Date tracking functional for temporal analysis

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance

- **Query Efficiency**: Queries appear optimized with appropriate joins
- **Data Volume**: Current 15 matches, 26 players is lightweight
- **Refresh Interval**: Auto-refresh configured via `refresh-interval` component

### Scalability Considerations

As tournament grows:

1. **Player Count**: Heatmap and timeline may need limits (currently top 10-15)
2. **Match History**: Timeline query fetches all matches - may need pagination
3. **Pivot Operations**: Player-civ heatmap could become expensive with many players
4. **Table Pagination**: Already implemented, good for scaling
5. **Chart Rendering**: Plotly handles medium datasets well, may need optimization at scale

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **Caching**: Add query result caching for expensive aggregations
2. **Incremental Updates**: Only refresh changed data, not full reload
3. **Lazy Loading**: Load tabs on-demand rather than all at once
4. **Materialized Views**: Pre-compute common aggregations in database
5. **Client-Side Filtering**: For large tables, push filtering to client

---

## Testing Considerations

### Test Coverage Needs

1. **Callback Logic**: Unit tests for all callback functions
2. **Edge Cases**: Empty data, single player, tied win rates
3. **Filter Combinations**: Test all filter permutations
4. **Data Validation**: Ensure win rates, counts calculated correctly
5. **UI Interactions**: Integration tests for dropdowns, sliders, tabs
6. **Error Handling**: Verify graceful degradation on errors

### Test Data Requirements

- Players with varying match counts (1, 5, 10, 50+)
- Complete head-to-head matchups
- Players who play single vs. multiple civilizations
- Temporal data spanning multiple weeks/months
- Edge cases: 100% win rate, 0% win rate, exactly 50%

---

## Accessibility Notes

The page should consider:

1. **Color Blindness**: Heatmap uses red-yellow-green scale - ensure sufficient contrast
2. **Screen Readers**: Add ARIA labels to interactive elements
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all controls accessible via keyboard
4. **Text Alternatives**: Charts should have descriptive titles and alt text
5. **Contrast Ratios**: Verify all text meets WCAG standards

---
