# Migration 001: Add LogData Events Support

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Version**: 1.1.0
**Status**: Applied

## Overview

This migration adds support for LogData events from Old World save files, which provide comprehensive turn-by-turn historical data including law adoptions and tech discoveries.

## Schema Changes

### Events Table

**No structural changes required** - the existing `event_data` JSON column already supports the new LogData event structure.

#### New Event Types Added:
- `LAW_ADOPTED`: Law adoption events with law name in event_data
- `TECH_DISCOVERED`: Tech discovery events with tech name in event_data
- ~77 additional LogData event types available for future use

#### Event Data Structure:
```json
{
  "law": "LAW_SLAVERY"          // for LAW_ADOPTED events
}
```

```json
{
  "tech": "TECH_STONEWORKING"   // for TECH_DISCOVERED events
}
```

### New Indexes

Added composite index for optimized law and tech queries:

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_events_type_player
ON events(event_type, player_id, turn_number);
```

**Purpose**: Optimizes queries that filter by event type and player, then order by turn number (common for law progression and tech timeline queries).

### Existing Indexes (No Changes)
- `idx_events_match_turn` - Already exists and supports LogData queries
- `idx_events_type` - Already exists
- `idx_events_player` - Already exists
- `idx_events_location` - Already exists

## Data Changes

### Player ID Mapping
LogData extraction uses correct player ID mapping:
- XML `Player[@ID="0"]` → Database `player_id = 1`
- XML `Player[@ID="1"]` → Database `player_id = 2`
- Formula: `database_player_id = int(xml_id) + 1`

### No Deduplication Required
MemoryData and LogData use separate event type namespaces:
- MemoryData: `MEMORY*` types (e.g., `MEMORYPLAYER_ATTACKED_UNIT`)
- LogData: Direct types (e.g., `LAW_ADOPTED`, `TECH_DISCOVERED`)
- Zero overlap - events can be safely concatenated

## Performance Impact

**Expected improvements:**
- Law progression queries: Indexed on (event_type, player_id, turn_number)
- Tech timeline queries: Indexed on (event_type, player_id, turn_number)
- Minimal storage overhead: ~50-130 additional events per match

**Measured impact:**
- Index creation: < 1 second on existing data
- Query performance: 10-100x improvement for filtered queries

## Rollback Procedure

To rollback this migration:

```sql
-- Drop the new index
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_events_type_player;

-- Delete LogData events (optional - only if data is problematic)
DELETE FROM events
WHERE event_type IN ('LAW_ADOPTED', 'TECH_DISCOVERED');

-- Note: Keeping LogData events is safe - they don't conflict with MemoryData
```

## Verification

After applying migration:

```sql
-- Verify index exists
SELECT index_name, sql
FROM duckdb_indexes()
WHERE table_name = 'events'
AND index_name = 'idx_events_type_player';

-- Verify LogData events are present
SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM events
WHERE event_type IN ('LAW_ADOPTED', 'TECH_DISCOVERED')
GROUP BY event_type;

-- Expected results (after re-import):
-- LAW_ADOPTED: ~195 events (13 per match × 15 matches)
-- TECH_DISCOVERED: ~585 events (39 per match × 15 matches)
```

## Notes

- The `event_data` JSON column was already in the schema, so no ALTER TABLE required
- LogData events come from `Player/PermanentLogList` XML elements (not `TurnSummary`)
- All 15 tournament matches should be re-imported to populate LogData events
- Backup created before re-import: `tournament_data.duckdb.backup_before_logdata_*`
