We are using uv to manage Python

## Development Principles

### YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)
- Only implement features/fixes that are needed NOW
- Don't add abstractions or features that "might be useful later"
- Example: "Only fix the player ID mapping, don't refactor other things"
- Example: "Only implement law and tech events now, not all 79 event types"

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Reuse existing code patterns and logic
- If the same logic exists elsewhere (e.g., LogData player ID mapping), use the same approach
- Don't duplicate code - extract to shared functions if needed
- Example: MemoryData and LogData should use identical player ID conversion: `database_player_id = xml_player_id + 1`

### Atomic Commits
- Each commit should represent ONE logical change
- Commit frequently (after each task/subtask completion)
- Commit messages should clearly describe what changed and why
- Don't batch multiple unrelated changes into one commit

### Code Comments
- Comments should explain **WHY**, not **WHAT**
- The code itself should be clear enough to show what it does
- Document edge cases, business rules, and non-obvious decisions
- Example: Good comment explains XML ID mapping rationale, not just the formula

## Commit Messages

Do NOT include these lines in commit messages:
- `ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`
- `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`

Use conventional commit format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation
- `test:` for tests
- `refactor:` for code changes that don't add features or fix bugs
- `perf:` for performance improvements
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

## Application Management

Use `manage.py` to control the Dash web application:
- `uv run python manage.py start` - Start the server
- `uv run python manage.py stop` - Stop the server
- `uv run python manage.py restart` - Restart the server (useful after code changes)
- `uv run python manage.py status` - Check server status
- `uv run python manage.py logs` - Show server logs
- `uv run python manage.py logs -f` - Follow server logs (like tail -f)

The server runs on http://localhost:8050 by default.

## Database Management

### DuckDB Operations

The project uses DuckDB (`data/tournament_data.duckdb`) for analytics.

**Always backup before major changes:**
```bash
cp data/tournament_data.duckdb data/tournament_data.duckdb.backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
```

**Inspect database:**
```bash
# Read-only mode (safe)
uv run duckdb data/tournament_data.duckdb -readonly

# Check schema
uv run duckdb data/tournament_data.duckdb -readonly -c "DESCRIBE events"

# Query data
uv run duckdb data/tournament_data.duckdb -readonly -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events"
```

**Re-import data:**
```bash
# Test first (dry-run)
uv run python scripts/import_tournaments.py --directory saves --dry-run

# Full re-import (removes existing data)
uv run python scripts/import_tournaments.py --directory saves --force --verbose
```

### Validation After Changes

Always run validation scripts after database changes:
```bash
# For LogData-related changes
uv run python scripts/validate_logdata.py

# For MemoryData-related changes
uv run python scripts/validate_memorydata_ownership.py

# For analytics queries
uv run python scripts/verify_analytics.py
```

## Testing & Code Quality

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
uv run pytest -v

# With coverage report
uv run pytest --cov=tournament_visualizer

# Specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_parser_logdata.py -v
```

### Code Formatting & Linting

**Before committing, always run:**
```bash
# Format code
uv run black tournament_visualizer/

# Lint code
uv run ruff check tournament_visualizer/

# Auto-fix linting issues
uv run ruff check --fix tournament_visualizer/
```

### Test-Driven Development

Follow TDD principles for new features:
1. Write failing test first
2. Implement minimum code to pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Commit when all tests pass

## Old World Save File Structure

### Player ID Mapping (Critical!)

**XML uses 0-based IDs, database uses 1-based:**
```python
# XML: <Player ID="0">
# Database: player_id = 1
database_player_id = int(xml_id) + 1
```

**Important:** Player ID="0" is valid and should NOT be skipped!

### Data Sources

**MemoryData Events** (limited historical data):
- Character/diplomatic memories for AI decision-making
- Event types: `MEMORYPLAYER_*`, `MEMORYFAMILY_*`, etc.
- Location: Various places in XML

**LogData Events** (comprehensive turn-by-turn logs):
- Complete gameplay history
- Event types: `LAW_ADOPTED`, `TECH_DISCOVERED`, `GOAL_STARTED`, etc.
- Location: `Player/PermanentLogList/LogData` elements
- **No overlap with MemoryData** - different event type namespaces

### Memory Event Ownership

**Key Concept**: MemoryData events are stored in a player's MemoryList, representing that player's perspective/memory.

**XML Structure:**
```xml
<Player ID="0">  <!-- Owner player -->
  <MemoryList>
    <MemoryData>
      <Type>MEMORYPLAYER_ATTACKED_CITY</Type>
      <Player>1</Player>  <!-- Subject player (opponent) -->
      <Turn>63</Turn>
    </MemoryData>
    <MemoryData>
      <Type>MEMORYTRIBE_ATTACKED_UNIT</Type>
      <Tribe>TRIBE_RAIDERS</Tribe>  <!-- NO <Player> child -->
      <Turn>63</Turn>
    </MemoryData>
  </MemoryList>
</Player>
```

**Player ID Assignment:**

1. **MEMORYPLAYER_* events**: Use `<Player>` child element (the opponent/subject)
   - Example: If Becked's memory says "MEMORYPLAYER_ATTACKED_CITY Player=1",
     it means Becked remembers Fluffbunny (Player 1) attacking a city

2. **MEMORYTRIBE/FAMILY/RELIGION_* events**: Use owner `Player[@ID]` (the viewer)
   - Example: If Becked's memory says "MEMORYTRIBE_ATTACKED_UNIT Tribe=Raiders",
     it means Becked witnessed/experienced Raiders attacking units
   - No `<Player>` child element exists for these events

**Database Mapping:**
- XML `Player[@ID="0"]` â†’ Database `player_id=1`
- XML `Player[@ID="1"]` â†’ Database `player_id=2`
- Consistent with LogData event mapping

### XML Structure Notes

- Save files are `.zip` archives containing a single `.xml` file
- Extract for inspection: `unzip -p saves/match_*.zip | head -n 1000`
- Root element contains match metadata as attributes
- Player elements contain turn-by-turn data

## Documentation Standards

### Documentation Structure

```
docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ developer-guide.md      # Architecture and how-to guides
â”œâ”€â”€ migrations/             # Database schema changes
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 001_*.md           # Numbered migration docs
â””â”€â”€ plans/                  # Implementation plans and investigations
    â””â”€â”€ feature-name-implementation-plan.md
```

### Migration Documentation

Every schema change needs a migration doc in `docs/migrations/`:
- **Overview**: What and why
- **Schema Changes**: Specific SQL changes
- **Rollback Procedure**: How to undo
- **Verification**: How to test it worked
- **Related Files**: What code changed

### Implementation Plans

For complex features, create an implementation plan in `docs/plans/`:
- Task breakdown with time estimates
- Testing strategy
- Success metrics
- Commit checkpoints

See `docs/plans/logdata-ingestion-implementation-plan.md` as an example.

## Chyllonge Library Notes

When working with the chyllonge library (Challonge API client):

### Setup
- Requires environment variables:
  - `CHALLONGE_KEY`: API key from https://challonge.com/settings/developer
  - `CHALLONGE_USER`: Challonge username
- Initialize client: `api = ChallongeAPI()`

### API Response Structure
- The library returns **flat dictionaries**, not nested under keys like 'tournament' or 'match'
- Access fields directly: `match['id']`, `tournament['name']`
- No need to check for nested structures like `match['match']` or `tournament['tournament']`

### Common API Calls
```python
# Get all matches
matches = api.matches.get_all(tournament_id)

# Get all attachments for a match
attachments = api.attachments.get_all(tournament_id, match_id)
```

### Attachments
- Available fields:
  - `asset_url`: Download URL (missing protocol prefix, prepend 'https:')
  - `asset_file_name`: Original filename
  - `asset_file_size`: File size in bytes
  - `asset_content_type`: MIME type
- URLs come as `//s3.amazonaws.com/...` - add `https:` prefix for downloads

### Common Gotchas
- `attachment_count` can be `None`, always check `if attachment_count and attachment_count > 0:`
- All responses are flat dictionaries, consistent API design
- Supports Python 3.8-3.11
