## Application Management

Use `manage.py` to control the Dash web application:
- `uv run python manage.py start` - Start the server
- `uv run python manage.py stop` - Stop the server
- `uv run python manage.py restart` - Restart the server (useful after code changes)
- `uv run python manage.py status` - Check server status
- `uv run python manage.py logs` - Show server logs
- `uv run python manage.py logs -f` - Follow server logs (like tail -f)

The server runs on http://localhost:8050 by default.

## PyChallonge Library Notes

When working with the pychallonge library:

### API Response Structure
- The library returns **flat dictionaries**, not nested under keys like 'tournament' or 'match'
- Always handle both flat and nested structures for compatibility:
  ```python
  # Handle both nested and flat structure
  if 'match' in match:
      match_data = match['match']
  else:
      match_data = match
  ```

### Attachments
- Use `challonge.attachments.index(tournament_id, match_id)` (NOT `challonge.match_attachments`)
- Available fields:
  - `asset_url`: Download URL (missing protocol prefix, prepend 'https:')
  - `asset_file_name`: Original filename
  - `asset_file_size`: File size in bytes
  - `asset_content_type`: MIME type
- URLs come as `//s3.amazonaws.com/...` - add `https:` prefix for downloads

### Common Gotchas
- `attachment_count` can be `None`, always check `if attachment_count and attachment_count > 0:`
- Tournament data structure is flat, access directly: `tournament['name']` not `tournament['tournament']['name']`
- Match data structure is also flat: `match['id']` not `match['match']['id']`
